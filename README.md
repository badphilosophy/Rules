Rules?
=====

Welcome to Bad Philosophy's Rule Repo!

We believe working within interesting constraints makes us more creative, and that more creativity leads to better shows and thus more entertaining podcasts for YOU to enjoy. As of Episode 150, we are experimenting with an open and regularly changing rule set governing our constructed reality here at Bad Philosophy.

Introductory Episode:

Introduction
============

* The Rule Set governs how we produce the show, what we talk about, etc.
* The current Rule Set is always visible in this Repo and at: http://www.badphilosophy.com/blog/rules/
* Every three episodes, we adopt a New Rule Set during a special Rule Set Update
* In the Rule Set Update we do three things:
  * Change one value of one rule
  * Remove one rule completely
  * Add one new rule with initial values
* Each Rule Set Update, ONE of these actions is taken by each of these parties:
  * Stephen
  * Kevin
  * YOU the audience!
* Which action is whose changes each Rule Set Update
* Each party can lock one rule before the Update. That rule is then immune until the next Rule Set Update. The same party cannot lock the same rule for two consecutive Rule Set Updates.
* After the Rule Set Update, the new Rule Set applies to all episodes until the next Rule Set Update

Example rule format: “[Person value] takes [action value] every [number value] episodes”
